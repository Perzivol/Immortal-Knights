Set of five unique loading bars. Not much documentation for this. Couple of things to point out.

Resizing should be fine if you want them biger or smaller.
Elements are custom shapes and the rest (Ornaments) are handpainted smart objects. 
You can scale them, but within the reasonable parameters. Ctrl+T on the selected Group Folder will do nicely.
